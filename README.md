# HangAround

HangAround is an app for when you want to make sure everybody knows what they are supposed to bring at your next BBQ.

You can create upcoming activities and add your friends as participants. They can be assigned custom roles so that everybody knows their responsibility.

Use it to organise your next backyard BBQ, plan your next camping trip, arrange the next time you go to a festival with friends...
